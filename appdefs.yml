      - title: Access to Optical Drives
        level: 2
        content: |-
          By default, a Docker container does not have access to host's devices. However,
          access to one or more devices can be granted with the `--device DEV` parameter
          of the `docker run` command.

          In Linux, optical drives are represented by device files named `/dev/srX`, where
          `X` is a number (e.g., `/dev/sr0` for the first drive, `/dev/sr1` for the
          second, etc). To allow {{ app.friendly_name }} to access the first drive, use
          this parameter:

          ```
          --device /dev/sr0
          ```

          To identify the correct Linux devices to expose, check the container's log
          during startup. Look for messages like:
          ```
          [cont-init   ] 54-check-optical-drive.sh: looking for usable optical drives...
          [cont-init   ] 54-check-optical-drive.sh: found optical drive 'hp HLDS DVDRW GUD1N LD02' [/dev/sr0]
          [cont-init   ] 54-check-optical-drive.sh:   [ OK ]   associated SCSI CD-ROM (sr) device detected: /dev/sr0.
          [cont-init   ] 54-check-optical-drive.sh:   [ ERR ]  the host device /dev/sr0 is not exposed to the container.
          [cont-init   ] 54-check-optical-drive.sh: no usable optical drives found.
          ```

          This indicates that `/dev/sr0` needs to be exposed to the container.

          > [!TIP]
          > View the containerâ€™s log by running `docker logs <container_name>`.

          Alternatively, identify Linux devices from the host by running:

          ```
          lsscsi -k
          ```

          The output's last column for an optical drive indicates the device to expose.
          The following example shows that `/dev/sr0` should be exposed:

          ```
          [0:0:0:0]    disk    ATA      SanDisk SSD PLUS 9100  /dev/sda
          [1:0:0:0]    disk    ATA      SanDisk SSD PLUS 9100  /dev/sdb
          [2:0:0:0]    disk    ATA      ST3500418AS      HP34  /dev/sdc
          [4:0:0:0]    cd/dvd  hp HLDS  DVDRW  GUD1N     LD02  /dev/sr0
          ```
